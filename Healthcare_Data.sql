The IN clause checks for existence in active_patients but does not create duplicates.
If pat.id is unique in the patients table, then IN will only keep those unique values that match.
Even if active_patients contains duplicate patient values, it wonâ€™t affect the final result because IN only tests for membership, not multiplicity.*/
